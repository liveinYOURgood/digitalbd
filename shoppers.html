        <H1 class="yellowTitleBar">I LOVED <span class="pro2">LIVING</span> HERE</span></H1>



        <h1 class="bodytext">  After A&P, I found myself to have the great fortune to join the design team for Shoppers Supermarket (Super Valu) in Bowie, MD. I worked for Ivie & Associates officially. (based out of Flower Mound, TX which is by Dallas.)  

            <img class="BuildingPics" src="images/shoppers.jpg" alt="SHOPPERS STORE FRONT picture">

            They assigned me to this satellite location by Washington, D.C. Here also, I designed circulars and created more publications which added value daily. I even designed pages for Shop N Save and Farmfresh as well as spearheaded the El Tiempo Latino Full Page Newspaper Ad project during this time. (for Shoppers, through the Washington Post Newspaper.)

            <h1 class="bodytextTEST">"I throughly enjoyed my time working with Bill, and truly came to know him as an asset to my team. He is creative, timely and dependable. Bill was always inspired by a challenge and often exceeded expectations in his designs. Along with his undeniable talents, Bill has always been an absolute joy to work with. He was a real asset to the team and collaborated well with his teammates as well as the client."<br>

      <h1 class="bodytext"> I was only there for two years because they packed up this satellite location to join again the Shoppers Corporate Office and ‚Äúmoved shop‚Äù to MN. They already had a full staff in MN so I moved back north to join forces with Clark Printing in Fairfield, NJ as my next adventure awaited...</h1>
